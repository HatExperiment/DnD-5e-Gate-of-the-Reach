## Introduction

In the year 1400, **Luth Amastacia**, a Half-Elf Warlock bound to a flaming Aspect of Corellon, was one of the four heroes of legend 
(with [Narrinesh](https://gotr2024.netlify.app/posts/narrinesh-the-monk/), [Stuu the Dwarf](https://gotr2024.netlify.app/posts/stuu-the-dwarf/), and [Nirvana Knives](https://gotr2024.netlify.app/posts/nirvana-knives/))
who foiled the Necromancer's plans in the Gate of the Reach fortress under the mountain. A spellcaster adept with a blade, Luth's small stature belied his 
tremendous courage, curiousity, and bravery in the face of grave danger. Evildoers who made the mistake of underestimating this 12-year old boy quickly learned the 
folly of their ways.

#### Appearance

Luth is a charismatic youth with misty grey eyes and a tan complexion. His hair is swept back, peppery black at the roots with white blonde tips. 
Luth's boyish charms serve him well when getting past the rich and powerful without a second glance. He appears harmless, seemingly only wearing a small golden amulet around his neck and a book at his waist.
However, looks can be deceiving: on command, the amulet becomes a brilliant, golden shortsword which Luth is extremely skilled at wielding
to smite unholy and undead alike. With a simple word and a glance, golden bolts like meteors fly from his hand to incinerate targets at 
 range. Luth's power at such a young age should concern any evil creatures of the land, lest he grow up to rid the world of evil entirely. His
 patron, an elemental aspect of the Elvish God Corellon, manifests only extremely rarely in the physical world as a figure entirely aflame, his features in the shape of Prince Ghif, Luth's
 grandfather. Otherwise, the Aspect communicates only through the amulet Luth bears upon his chest.

## Deeds

#### Act 1
- Using the small amount of information that his patron gave him, and a map projected onto his golden amulet, Luth led the adventuring party through the memory of the Fall of Ythenia and met his newest adventuring companions. **Good Deed**
> *"Spells fly across the plaza: fireballs, great tracing arcs of lightning and spirling purple missiles, many of them flying from the roofs and windows of the buildings surrounding the plaza. The sound of tramping feet, shouting, and crying resounds underneath what sounds like thunder claps, and an everpresent BOOM that repeats again and again as massive flaming projectiles impact the shield surrounding the city."* (Session 19)

- Atop the Vilhon Reach mountains in a small warm cabin, when all of his companions had fallen fast asleep due to the deep sleep of the perilous Merulian Tea, Luth was able to resist the effects and warn his new friends of impending danger of Rye Harrigan. **Good Deed**
> *"The sickly smell of ginger and lemon smoke upwards from the kettle on the ever-burning firepit in the center of the hut, and one small half-elf boy can smell that the leaves inside have begun to burn. The water has all but evaporated. As you rise, the hut is deathly quiet, other than the gentle snoozing of the dwarf, tiefling, and dragonborn laying on pillows around the hut. The old Half-Orc is nowhere to be seen."* (Session 24)

- Luth proclaimed himself "The Seeker" when challenged by Feroi, the Elven Warrior. **Neutral Deed**

- Tapping into his magical abilities, Luth solved the Elvish puzzle box containing the Blood Orange Gem, discovering his natural talent to untangle complicated magical enchantments and unlocking a gift for studying abstract arcane topics.
Luth would make a fine wizard's apprentice! **Heroic Deed**

- At the grizzly feast of the elvish terrorist group the Eldreth Veluuthra, Luth found himself in a living nightmare. Even though he was the only one in the party who could speak Elvish, he was at the mercy of Nirvana Knives who dictated the negotiations of the party with Tellia. Knives chose not to fight for Briff but to leave them to the elves in exchange for Arrabarean reinforcements. Luth felt powerless as he listened to the elves around them talk about the spellcasters like they were no higher than dirt, mistakes in nature's creation. **Neutral Deed**
> *"As the elves begin to herd the spellcasters down the length of the table, jeers and insults are thrown at them. Up and over the magical containment barrier, pieces of raw meat from the feast are thrown at the beaten and bloodied Briff and the spellcasters in a twisted game."* (Session 37)



#### Act 2

- By Act 2, Luth Amastacia hadn't even had time to internally process how he felt during this whole adventure. He had been thrust into this ordeal by his patron.
Luth felt that he had pretty much died once before, so this might be his second chance to save the world. At this moment in time, he had lingering questions about what was
happening under the mountain. Ultimately, however, Luth enjoyed being surrounded by friends.

- Luth, the one adventurer who was willing to undergo the ritual, sat in the Church at Yargongone to become willingly tattooed in Henisara's blood.
The tattoo was enchanted, enabling Luth to be able to see souls trapped within the Unity Stone, reliving the moment of their deaths
in the mountain every night, giving Luth insights as to the curse of the mountain and the events of 50 years ago. In return, however, Luth unknowingly came under the dominion and control of Harolda and the Silver Flame's blood magic.
Harolda initially intended to use the tattoo to command and sacrifice Luth, but turned against the idea when she saw in Luth a new, powerful crusader convert for the Silver Flame. **Neutral Deed**
> *"You have the four vials of blood... to receive the blessing of the soul who bled, would enable you to see visions from the past, images flickering on the mortal plane. Your blades, even, would cut through realms, striking the departed as if they stood right next to you. All that you would need ... would be a tattoo of blood."* (Session 38)

- While rowing on the Akanamere Marsh, Luth received a dispelled a false, illusionary vision of Feroi, the elf, and achieved a boon to his faith and his Wisdom. **Good Deed**
> *"On the surface of the water, a young elf rows towards your boat, with bulky, hand-made leather armor and two floating swords on their back. Rowing beside you, they speak in a hiss: "Seeker Luth... why did you fail us? They were slaughtered - each and every one. Hunted like game in the forest. Why did you leave them to their fate to preserve the deal with the Eldreth Veluuthra?"* (Session 43)

- By Session 15, when Henisara Mistifine was pushed over the edge by the leadership of the Gate of the Reach adventurers, and began to conspire to use the party of four as pawns, Luth was instrumental to her changing her mind. She saw potential in the boy and truly believed that he wanted to know about the Silver Flame. Luth ensured that 
 the Church building was constructed at Yargongone, thus fulfilling Harolda's quest and turning her to their side. **Good Deed**

- Luth paid 100 gold to Gretchen to send a message to Briff: "It's Luth, Are You Well? Would Like To See You." One of Gretchen's crows returned a bloodied scrap of yellow robe. Briff was deceased. **Neutral Deed**

- Luth said a prayer for the spirits of the deceased within the Gate of the Reach Stronghold room, where the riled spirits would eventually become a maelstorm of malice. **Good Deed**

- Luth felt some curiousity about Aeron Morieth early in the adventure.
> *"A half-elf man sits at a desk covered in papers and quills, scribbling away at a piece of parchment. His brow is furrowed, and he appears completely out of space and time. As you watch, he raises his hand without a glance and traces a run in the air. The symbol shines brightly before disappearing."* (Session 55)

- Luth blissfully released Henisara's vengeful spirit with the rest of his party, freeing her from her eternal tormernt. As one last favor for being so mercifully released, Henisara allowed Luth with one wish: "I wish to see my family again." Fineghal Stormwalker answered this wish with a message: **Good Deed**
> *"Your fate is intertwined with Feroi. Find them when this is all over, and they will be able to help you to your family again. Travel to the city of Cimbar."* (Session 70)

#### Act 3

- Imbued with a tattoo and sleeping at night in Yargongone, Luth alone was able to hear the sounds of screams and wails coming from the inside of the Gate of the Reach.

- Luth was one of the key contributers in deciding that it was best not to confront the dracolich Akulu the vile head on. As the curse of the mountain took hold, Luth and his party became more afflicted by horrible visions than ever. **Neutral Deed**
> *"As you step through the Gate of the Reach, you find yourselves surrounded by ghouls in a large circle. One ghoul in particular, with long limbs and albino white skin, looks at you hungrily from a pack of gaunt, drooling, and dripping ghouls with red blood dripping from fangs and claws. It howls, and says "Out of the way! Give them some space!" (Session 70)

- Luth discovered that his muscles were being shrunk from within by the Necromancer's curse, and the increased strength he felt every time he left the mountain was a ruse.
When the fungal colony beneath the marsh offered to heal the muscles, Luth took the potion, electing to restore the decaying muscles inside his body instead of taking on unnatural fungal strength that would have restored some of the deceptive power the necromancy magic granted. **Neutral Deed**

-  Luth needed to unlock and disable the Corrupted Unity Stone's inner mechanisms, so called upon his patron to do so. In exchange for his Patron's help, his Patron purged Luth
of all of his commitment to the Church of the Silver Flame: Luth's body caught on fire as his tattoos were incinerated, and the Book of the Silver Flame reduced to ashes in a manner
of seconds. Black scars are all that remain of the tattoos once etched in blood beneath Luth's skin. **Neutral Deed** 

- Luth, as a member of the party of four, defeated the Necromancer within his foul cathedral inside the Corrupted Unity Stone. Luth and his
companions saw how Nirvana Knives was tempted to take the power of the Corrupted Unity Stone for herself and gain all of the power that Aeron
Morieth had as the Necromancer. In exchange for controlling the stone and preventing it from falling into the wrong hands, she would sacrifice
herself, becoming corrupted and evil from that point forward. Luth played an instrumental role in convincing Nirvana Knives not to take this
path, and instead disconnect the Corrupted Unity Stone from the Torch of the Reach. Later then, the adventurers could find a way to remove
the hundreds of thousands of souls from the stone. The Party of Four successfully ended the enchantment, stealing the Corrupted Unity Stone,
the Necromancer's critical source of power, from the Necromancer. Unfortunately, the adventurers now had to find a way to remove the souls from the stone...
 and Aeron Morieth would never rest, would send all of his servants, assassins, and monsters out into the world, until he regained control of the stone for himself
 once again. **Heroic Deed**
 
- By fulfilling the task that his Patron set out for him, to rid the Akanamere marsh of the undead menace, Luth fulfilled an extremely important bargain. Luth has proven himself
as a capable instrument of the light to his Patron, and will receive limitless power as the bond with the Aspect of Corellon becomes stronger and stronger. With great trust built
in this relationship, Luth will wield the power of the light with brilliant and blinding strength. **Heroic Deed**
> *"Deep in your soul, you feel more than hear the satisfaction of your patron rumbling deep inside you like a great lion: "You have done well..."

## Aftermath

1) The Resurrection Mechanism within the Corrupted Unity Stone was prematurely activated before all four pieces of the Torch of the Reach were plugged in. Without all of the pieces in place, Akulu would never be able to resurrect. The spell miscast, causing an eruption of souls to build into a volcano and carry the players out of the top of the mountain. The bones of Akulu the Vile were destroyed completely by the corrosive acid of the soul residue, which does not damage the living, only that which is dead.

2) In his quest to recapture the stone, the Necromancer Aeron Morieth will hunt Luth down until he has his revenge, sending undead assassins and agents to seek him out. He will never feel safe while Aeron Morieth is alive.

3) The Fate of the Soldiers of Yargongone was poor. Many soldiers died in the battle. Both Holden and Ishmir were slain, overwhelmed by the ghouls that they fought against. The remnants of the troops remained loyal to Nirvana Knives.

4) The spellcaster refugees of the reach did well in the face of the overwhelming odds of the Purge of Ire. While the Whispering Serpents with Nirvana Knives traded the life of Briff and his school for reinforcements, the Spellweavers Rebellion grew and gained many members. They would grow into a sizable movement.

5) The Original Expedition: Banger, Harolda, Theresa, and Beth, fared well in the battle. Over the long-term, the players were able to please all four of them by completing their building construction side-objective quests. Luth was responsible for winning the loyalty of the Church, a key ally in ensuring control over Yargongone. Because of this, there was no treachery; all four of these key characters stayed loyal during the final battle for the Reach.

6) Of the reinforcements, the 5th Detachment of the 2nd Coming of the Silver Flame, nothing remained. The soldiers, fractured and divided as an army between Nirvana Knives and the High Marshall, were slain ruthlessly and utterly. Their bodies littered the forest floor like many scattered leaves.

7) The Holy Kingdom of Arrabar would rule for many years to come.

From being thrust upon a strange quest, to the dramatic conclusion of the Gate of the Reach, Luth had gone from inexperience and mistrust
to being the sole bearer, the sole hope, of the disenchantment of the Corrupted Unity Stone to release the hundreds of thousands of souls captured within. 
It was a large burden indeed, and no other child would ever relate to. Yet, despite red and black dragons, necromancers, great wizards, and fields of undead, Luth was 
optimistically, unchangably just a kid. Nothing would change that. Striding on his solitary path on the dirt road heading north out of Yargongone for the last time, disguised with a hood cast over his head,
Luth felt a slight spring in his step. Despite the fact he had never felt so far from friends and kin, he did not feel alone. As the warm, white light of his patron sheathed his figure and cast him 
magically far across the land Luth smiled. He knew that if he but reached out, if he called on his new friends, they would be there to help him on this final leg of the quest. As Luth stood
in the center of Cimbar, the Corrupted Unity Stone concealed carefully beneath his robe, he felt more ready than ever to find Tzchazzar, find Feroi, and find his family for once
and for good.
