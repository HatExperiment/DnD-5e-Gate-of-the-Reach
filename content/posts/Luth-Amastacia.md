## Aftermath

1) The Resurrection Mechanism within the Corrupted Unity Stone was prematurely activated before all four pieces of the Torch of the Reach were plugged in. Without all of the pieces in place, Akulu would never be able to resurrect. The spell miscast, causing an eruption of souls to build into a volcano and carry the players out of the top of the mountain. The bones of Akulu the Vile were destroyed completely by the corrosive acid of the soul residue, which does not damage the living, only that which is dead.

2) In his quest to recapture the stone, the Necromancer Aeron Morieth will hunt Luth down until he has his revenge, sending undead assassins and agents to seek him out. He will never feel safe while Aeron Morieth is alive.

3) The Fate of the Soldiers of Yargongone was poor. Many soldiers died in the battle. Both Holden and Ishmir were slain, overwhelmed by the ghouls that they fought against. The remnants of the troops remained loyal to Nirvana Knives.

4) The spellcaster refugees of the reach did well in the face of the overwhelming odds of the Purge of Ire. While the Whispering Serpents with Nirvana Knives traded the life of Briff and his school for reinforcements, the Spellweavers Rebellion grew and gained many members. They would grow into a sizable movement.

5) The Original Expedition: Banger, Harolda, Theresa, and Beth, fared well in the battle. Over the long-term, the players were able to please all four of them by completing their building construction side-objective quests. Luth was responsible for winning the loyalty of the Church, a key ally in ensuring control over Yargongone. Because of this, there was no treachery; all four of these key characters stayed loyal during the final battle for the Reach.

6) Of the reinforcements, the 5th Detachment of the 2nd Coming of the Silver Flame, nothing remained. The soldiers, fractured and divided as an army between Nirvana Knives and the High Marshall, were slain ruthlessly and utterly. Their bodies littered the forest floor like many scattered leaves.

7) The Holy Kingdom of Arrabar would rule for many years to come.
