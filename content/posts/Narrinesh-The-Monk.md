## Introduction

In the year 1400, **Narrinesh**, a Dragonborn Rogueish-Monk of the Astral Self, was one of four heroes of legend (with [Nirvana Knives](https://gotr2024.netlify.app/posts/nirvana-knives/), [Stuu the Dwarf](https://gotr2024.netlify.app/posts/stuu-the-dwarf/), and Luth Amastacia) to foil the Necromancer's plans in the Gate of the Reach Fortress under the mountain. 
A deadly martial artist whose relaxed demeanor concealed a great ability to dominate his opponents in a flurry of deadly fists, Narrinesh remained stoic and placid despite the many terrors that the mountain wrought
upon him and his party. Narrinesh was a sworn vegetarian.

#### Appearance

Narrinesh is small for a Dragonborn, lean and as buff as a blacksmith, with green eyes and black scales. He often melts effortlessly into the shadows, on account of his relatively small, slim figure. Two sharp horns protrude from the back of his head and curve backwards. Narrinesh keeps himself assiduously clean,
and can often be found meditating, focusing his Ki, or talked into drinking alcohol with his good buddy Stuu. When Narrinesh channels his astral self form, two robotic arms manifest behind each of his shoulders to unleash multiple punches in a manner of seconds.
When someone attacks him, and even sometimes when unprovoked, Narrinesh opens his jaws wide to spit green acid in a cone in front of him, melting flesh and causing excruciating pain to any misfortunates in range.

## Deeds

#### Act 1
- When tousling with Norm the diamond-encrusted animated armor guarding the Circle Hallway which connects the outside of the mountain kingdom,
Stuu and Narrinesh tore off Norm's head from its body, ending the life of Norm.  **Neutral Deed** 
> *The Obituary of Norman, the Animated Suit of Armor: "Norman, or Norm as he was called by friends, died today. He was created by the chief architect of the Gate of the Reach kingdom, and encrusted with gems and jewels which would disintegrate upon his destruction. Although he once had many jobs, especially carrying around glass mosaics to be placed into the mountain in a secret teleportation network, after the death of his master he only had one job: to protect the Gate of the Reach from invaders. When the undead slaughtered all the residents, he failed his job, but never gave up his mission. Norm was named after Norm Monik, who was a famous folk hero from the Darkhook Square District of the Kingdom of Ythenia before its destruction. Norm had a brother, an unfinished, equally lavishly adorned suit of armor, which was positioned waiting to be animated within the architect's office at the bottom of the mountain, where it held a glass mosaic with an iron grip. Norm was a good suit of armor who enjoyed making haikus. His head would be used as a bludgeoning weapon by Stuu the dwarf in months to come." Engraved at the bottom of the headstone: "1+1+1  |  1+1+1+1  |  1+1+1"* (Session 5)

- After just arriving at the Gate of the Reach, while setting up a log-trap to ambush any undead that set themselves upon the camp, Holden and his detachment returning from a patrol accidentally triggered the log trap. Angrily confronted by Holden, who was convinced that the four adventurers had set the trap to kill them, Narrinesh spat vile acid directly across Holden's face, melting half of the skin off and leaving a permanent scar. This ended the argument. **Evil Deed**

- In a feat of astonishing athleticism that Narrinesh would later be known for, Narrinesh saved his friends on the perilous ice-covered rusted metal staircase in the Frozen Approach. While some members of the party fell through the metal, Stuu failing his athletic checks and nearly plummeting one-hundred feet to an untimely death, Narrinesh masterfully navigated the spiral staircase and saved his companions. The treachery of the frozen staircase was no match for Narrinesh's heroism. **Heroic Deed**
> *"From the edges of the room, twisting animated metal begins to travel upwards like vines reaching towards the sky, snow drifts flung from steel as it does so. AS you watch, the twisting grows more and more refined, more and more tight, until the metal forms itself into what appears to be a twisting spiral staircase. Looking up, you see the frozen staircase leads upwards into the ceiling far out of sight."* (Session 14)

- Feeling self-conscious about the orange orb concealed within his right palm, Narrinesh spoke with Theresa Milleau to get a glove. Nirvana Knives did not trust Narrinesh for hiding his palm, and the two adventurers had a fight to see who could dominate the other to reveal the palm. Narrinesh prevailed in this instance and was able to keep the nature of his right palm a secret. However, relations between him and Nirvana Knives would never be quite the same after. **Neutral Deed**
> *"Narrinesh - the controntation with Knives about your hand has left you feeling perhaps a little edgier than normally you feel like it should. After your near fight, you have felt something nagging in the back of your brain - twinging at your right palm. An angry voice rises in your head, and as it speaks, you feel an unfamiliar anger flare up within you. It's a fire that seems to emanate from your palm, directly into your skull."* (Session 23)

- In the Gate of the Reach under the mountain, Narrinesh discovered the blast powder forge, a large mechanism with combustible, white iridescent powder that powered a white-hot forge mechanism. After clearing out bats that made the cave home and reactivating the machinery, he promised Stuu that he would repair or remake his meat tenderizer hammer, but never got around to it. **Neutral Deed**

- Made a target by the simple fact of his black dragon lineage, Narrinesh successfully resisted possession by the Necromancer, Aeron Morieth, who attempted to kidnap him and make him run into the forest.
> *"Deep within the forest, something changes. A front of air, a mass of pressure, something born aloft above the leaves, flies like a missile towards the Vilhon Reach Encampment. It is an invisible force, shifting leaves, cutting through branches, and it spirals directly towards Narrinesh."* (Session 26)

- Narrinesh proclaimed herself "The Good" when challenged by Feroi, the Elven Warrior. **Neutral Deed** (Session 37)

- At the grizzly feast of the elvish terrorist group the Eldreth Veluuthra, where the main course of the meal was man flesh and Nirvana Knives made an evil deal to secure Arrabarean reinforcements in exchange for the lives of Brith and magic-wielding refugees from the Purge of Ire, Narrinesh was found crying.  (Session 37)

- Narrinesh overcame the effects of the orb within his palm on the boat ride in the marsh as his power grew, and eventually, was immune to the magical effects. **Good Deed**
> *"Just as you feel something come over you, as quickly as it started, it passes. Strangely enough, it was almost as if the magical effect from the orb was going to impact you, but in this moment, you were immune. A brief flash of anger, and then nothing. Warded off? Protected? A hot spell? You do not know."* (Session 43)

#### Act 2

- By Act 2, Narrinesh was considering internally whether his companions in the Gate of the Reach adventure were truly his friends. He was on the path to look for his sister, and instead, he had found companionship in his four adventurer companions. At this specific moment in time, Narrinesh wondered, "Why did I follow Stuu back to get beer?" (Presumably back into the mountain to refill at an old barrel somewhere.) **Neutral Deed**

- In multiple large-scale battles, especially in the first combat against the ghouls attacking the Yargongone encampment, Narrinesh truly came into his punching element: ducking and weaving, punching his way through piles of ghouls, Narrinesh displayed an incredible and deadly martial prowess. Often, he could take out five ghouls in a single turn just by the power of his fists. By Act 2, balanced in his mind and having overcome the orb in his palm, Narrinesh had become unstoppable. **Heroic Deed**

- In the Gate of the Reach fortress' Long March corridor, faced with a hallway with hanging ropes, each with deadly acids tied at the end of them as a trap, Narrinesh, rolling a 20, deftly climbed the ropes without disturbing any vials of acid, all the way to the top of the rope, to retrieve a bag of loot that he spotted at the very ceiling of the chamber. In doing so, he found a path for his companions through the trap. In addition, he discovered a rare 3-potion decanter. It was very cool. **Good Deed**

- Narrinesh blissfully released Henisara's vengeful spirit with the rest of his party, freeing her from her eternal torment. As one last favor
 for being so mercifully released, Henisara allowed Narrinesh with one wish: "The location of my sister and my master." Fineghal Stormwalker answered this wish with a message: **Good Deed**'
 > *"Your sister seeks you too, Narrinesh. Tzchazzar is not entirely lost to this world. Find the dragon, and she might help you to reunite with your master." Fineghal Stormwalker* (Session 70)
 
 - At the Battle of the Burning Torch, Narrinesh singlehandedly punched out whole battalions of undead ruthlessly. Through doing so, he carved a path through the forest that the reinforcements from Arrabar could travel to make their way to Yargongone and complete their objectives. Victory was won in large part due to the incredible martial prowess of Narrinesh. **Good Deed**
 > *"The forest fire has stirred all manner of creatures in the forest, as they run, hide, and dig for their lives. The ground tremors around you and trees shake, burn, and fall. The ground itself seems to moan like a large animal and buckles as pebbles and chunks of dirt cascade down the sides of hills and vales."* (Session 58)
 

#### Act 3

- By Act 3, Narrinesh found that sneaking through the branches of trees and dark mountain halls brought out a new strength in him. He took up the Rogue's mantle at Level 1. It was like a fish to water, as Narrinesh rolled incredible stealth rolls one after the next. Narrinesh could often be found slightly behind the party, covering the rear from the dark shadows. **Neutral Deed**

- While flying atop a gryphon while reliving the War of the Scale through the Corrupted Unity Stone, Narrinesh noticed that a solitary frost giant had broken morale and was beginning to run from the battle. Narrinesh internally debated whether the kill the frost giant. Just as the giant was about to escape the battle and make it out alive, Narrinesh decided to drop a bomb on the broken giant, instead of sparing its life. This was a deed of questionable morality. **Evil Deed**
> *"Your stomach drops as you see the sight of the ground, miles beneath you. The cold you feel is the bitter wind howling past your numb ears. You see a snowy land hurtle past you, villages, trees, woodsmoke, and fires in your sight as you fly past. Your hands grasp the leather reigns of a gigantic, flying bird, with a tan furry body underneath your frozen saddle."* (Session 66)

- Narrinesh played an instrumental role in solving Gretchen's puzzle inside the Corrupted Unity Stone, plugging in the pieces of the Torch of the Reach in the correct order so that the party could make it to the other side of the forest and make it further into the Corrupted Unity Stone enchantment.
> *"You find yourselves in a shop. In front of you, a beautiful, blonde human woman, 26 years of age, carries various jars and bottles of different sizes of alcohol, and pours the liquor into tumblers. You see wines, brandies, and different tonics and liquids on the shelves, all covered with cawing crows. The windows are dark with the night outside. On the wall, a sign reads "The Left-Handed Candle."* (Session 69)

- Narrinesh was one of the key contributors in deciding that it was best not to confront the dracolich Akulu the Vile head on. When eating pastries with Fineghal Stormwalker in his dream pastry shop on top of the Vilhon Reach, Narrinesh decided with the party that it would be best to find the hidden, unseen ways into the mountain, to sneak into the Corrupted Unity Stone enchantment and disenchant it from the source. Doing so, Narrinesh turned down the offer of the final piece of the Torch of the Reach. The enchantment would never be made complete again. **Neutral Deed**

- Narrinesh discovered that his muscles were being shrunk from within by the Necromancer's curse, and the increased strength he felt every time he left the mountain was a ruse.
When the fungal colony beneath the marsh offered to heal the muscles, Narrinesh took the potion, electing to restore the decaying muscles inside his body instead of taking on unnatural fungal strength that would have restored some of the deceptive power the necromancy magic granted. **Neutral Deed**

- Narrinesh, along with the party of four, defeated the Necromancer within his foul cathedral inside the Corrupted Unity Stone. 
 Narrinesh and his compatriots saw how Nirvana Knives was tempted to take the power of the Corrupted Unity Stone for herself
 and gain all the power that Aeron Morieth had as the Necromancer. In exchange for controlling the stone and preventing it from
 falling into the wrong hands, she would sacrifice herself, becoming corrupted and evil from that point forward. Narrinesh played an instrumental role in convincing
 Nirvana Knives not to take this path, and instead disconnect the Corrupted Unity Stone from the Torch of the Reach. Later then, the adventurers
 could find a way to remove the hundreds of thousands of souls from the stone. The Party of Four successfully ended the enchantment,
 stealing the Corrupted Unity Stone, the Necromancer's critical source of power, from the Necromancer. Unfortunately, the players now had to
 find a way to remove the souls from the stone... and Aeron Morieth would never rest, would send all of his servants, assassins, and monsters
 out into the world, until he regained control of the stone for himself once again. **Heroic Deed**

## Aftermath

1) The Resurrection Mechanism within the Corrupted Unity Stone was prematurely activated before all four pieces of the Torch of the Reach were plugged in. Without all of the pieces in place, Akulu would never be able to resurrect. The spell miscast, causing an eruption of souls to build into a volcano and carry the players out of the top of the mountain. The bones of Akulu the Vile were destroyed completely by the corrosive acid of the soul residue, which does not damage the living, only that which is dead.

2) In his quest to recapture the stone and get his revenge, the Necromancer Akulu the Vile will hunt Narrinesh down, sending undead assassins and agents to seek him out. Narrinesh will never feel safe or at ease while Aeron Morieth is alive.

3) The Fate of the Soldiers of Yargongone was poor. Many soldiers died in the battle. Both Holden and Ishmir were slain, overwhelmed by the ghouls that they fought against. The remnants of the troops remained loyal to Nirvana Knives after the fighting was done.

4) The spellcaster refugees of the reach did well in the face of the overwhelming odds of the Purge of Ire. While the Whispering Serpents with Nirvana Knives traded the life of Briff and his school for reinforcements, the Spellweavers Rebellion grew and gained many members. They would grow into a sizable movement.

5) The Original Expedition: Banger, Harolda, Theresa, and Beth, fared well in the battle. Over the long-term, the players were able to please all four of them by completing their building construction side-objective quests.  They were grateful for Stuu's leadership and remained faithful throughout the final battle for the Reach.

6) Of the reinforcements, the 5th Detachment of the 2nd Coming of the Silver Flame, nothing remained. The soldiers, fractured and divided as an army between Nirvana Knives and the High Marshall, were slain ruthlessly and utterly. Their bodies littered the forest floor like many scattered leaves.

7) The Holy Kingdom of Arrabar would rule for many years to come.

Narrinesh's road was a long one, yet it was far from done. The end of the Gate of the Reach Adventure still found Narrinesh seeking his sister. Narrinesh decided to set out onto the road with Stuu. The two of them, inseparable, traveled through hills and
vales, drinking their way through all the inns in the bustling major port cities, and through the secluded hamlets with single taverns nestled deep in forests. They gambled and spent their new-found wealth away. Sometimes, after a few drinks, they could be convinced to tell the tale of the Gate of the Reach, no one ever believed them. It was in a small desert hamlet, where Narrinesh had stayed for an unusually long time with Stuu,
that his twin sister Sorva appeared out of the desert. She claimed that her footsteps had been guided by a red dragon in her dreams. Leaving Stuu to his path, Narrinesh set off with his sister to reclaim the abandoned smithy that they were 
raised in, before monks, dragons, and evil necromancers - in his heart, Narrinesh knew he had finally found a life of peace for himself at last. As for the Corrupted Unity Stone? Should his friends come knocking at his door, perhaps once more, he would
set out with a pack on his back, to climb one more mountain, hop one more zipline, partake in one more adventure. He already had a lifetime of adventure, and he could be convinced to take another!
